Zero cost abstraction is:

"What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. 
And what you do use, you couldn’t do any better if you coded by hand."

By using zero cost abstractions, we write abstracted code (not handwritten assembly) and we couldn’t do any better if we tried to hand-write assembly. 

Iterators are zero cost abstractions in Rust. For loops are not. This is according to the Rust Book.
